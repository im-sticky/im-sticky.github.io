# im-sticky.github.io

This is a build for my personal website which is publicly available through the use github pages. While much of the content and code is for personal use, if you would like an easy to setup and deploy blog the structure of my site is available to view here for your own purposes.

## Local dev

The website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). To run local development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

Deploying is managed through GitHub actions. It is setup from [this blog post](https://gregrickaby.blog/article/nextjs-github-pages) and the deploy action can be found [here](/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
