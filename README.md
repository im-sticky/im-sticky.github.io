# im-sticky.github.io

This is the repository for my [personal website](https://im-sticky.github.io/) which is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I wrote a [blog post](https://im-sticky.github.io/blog/nextjs-on-github-pages) about hosting a static Next.js site on GitHub pages.

While much of the content and code is for personal use, if you would like an easy to setup and deploy website or blog, the structure is available to view here.

## Local development

To run local development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

Deploying is automatic whenever any commits are pushed to the `main` branch. It is managed through [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and the workflow is [here](/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
