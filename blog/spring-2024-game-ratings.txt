c:T4b5,Does this sound mind bending and cool as hell? Well, it is. And that's not my issue with the game. I think the concept is extremely cool and has the potential for making some pretty incredible puzzles. The problem I had was that the progression through the game which was gated by puzzles revolving around the orbs was really very linear. Most of the puzzles in the game really only had one option for you to try to solve them. I don't mean this in a "oh there was only one solution to the puzzle" kind of way. What I mean is that given the circumstances on what is presented to you, you only have one action you can take in the game to progress, where in most puzzles have multiple that may not yield a result. I kept thinking that this style of puzzle progression would change each time I acquired a new orb, but sometime after the third I realized that this wouldn't be the case. To be totally fair, this is not the case for the entire game. There are some sections where I stumbled, but they were far and few between. After finding the fourth orb the puzzles got a lot better and started requiring much more forethought than their predecessors, but unfortunately, that was the last 10-20% of the game.d:T420,This game was an unexpectedly beautiful experience. I knew it was essentially an atmospheric walking simulator, but I somehow had never heard the fact that the game is actually an online co-op experience. The first time I encountered another traveler, they came up to me and starting singing in excitement. Having been the first time I had seen someone and didn't know it was online multiplayer, I responded by jumping around and singing as well. They started doing the same and we spent maybe 5 minutes doing this. All I could think of while this was happening was: "wow, this AI seems weirdly good at mimicking what I'm doing". I pressed onward and the other traveler followed for a bit but we parted ways pretty shortly after. This happened another few times during my journey. A couple of the times we actually ended up spending a fair bit of time together progressing through parts of the world. The one section where you have to ascend a spiral tower I did entirely with a friend, which at the time, I thought was an NPC meant to be there to help me.e:T445,Collectables in this game are various letters, VHS and cassette tapes, internal government documents, pretty much anything that would be used by a government agency to store and send data internally or be sent from an external source. They provide an absolute ton of flavour to the world around you and what goes on inside the FBC. It ranges from anything to important information about an Object of Power or some stupid letter a civilian sent to about something that happened to them that could be the result of an Altered Item or AWE. Many of them are just plain funny and can even have a small sub-story that spans across a handful of correspondence you might find. For example, I found a set of internal memos between co-workers about a poker group they had set up. Someone was convinced another person was cheating and after some back and forth they ultimately got kicked out of the group. It isn't anything ground breaking or amazing but I love the small details that are added to give insight to the lives of the people who work at the FBC, some of them are just Joe Schmoes with a job.a:[["$","$Lb",null,{}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Hello and welcome to a set of reviews on the games I have played so far in 2024 (technically starting from my Christmas break in 2023).
