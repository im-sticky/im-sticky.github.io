I found myself re-using the same few things because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of spending time finding what I would actually want to swap to. They really needed either a wheel or categories to smooth out the quick swap. More slots to summon things rather than only having one would be a greatly appreciated change.

Collectables are also fairly unremarkable. There are a handful of collectibles outside the classic heart pieces, but there wasn't anything I found myself actively searching for.

The arcade shooter combat was also exasperated by the fact that some of the guns you unlocked were heavy weaponry that felt like they belonged in a modern ",["$","em",null,{"children":"Call of Duty"}]," game.
