Between the animation happening and the text popping up and hitting to continue the process, it takes maybe about a full 2 seconds for each iteration. The kicker to this is that you do ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"not"}]," get any additional time on your rope for the turn for each of these iterations.

When your turn ends in the middle of a ",["$","card-link",null,{"children":"Tainted Pact"}]," resolution, arena resolves the spell by exiling your whole library (or up to a duplicate card). So, if you have the ",["$","card-link",null,{"children":"Thassa's Oracle"}]," trigger on the stack when you cast ",["$","card-link",null,{"children":"Tainted Pact"}]," and you time out, Arena will resolve the spell and the trigger by exiling your whole library and giving you the win since ",["$","card-link",null,{"children":"Thassa's Oracle"}]," condition is resolved.

In my case, I had dragged ",["$","card-link",null,{"children":"Thassa's Oracle"}]," to cast it and hit my hotkey to turn on full-control. However, because of how quickly Arena resolves things, even though ",["$","card-link",null,{"children":"Thassa's Oracle"}]," was still visually on the stack for me when I activated full-control, Arena had already processed that its trigger was supposed to resolve not giving me the opportunity to cast ",["$","card-link",null,{"children":"Tainted Pact"}],".
