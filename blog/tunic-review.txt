b:T441, does differently to set it apart is really the meat of the game. Its world and challenge is molded by the NES era adventure games. Little to no information given to you in game, tons of secrets for you to find, and rooms of enemies that you cannot simply mash attack to get through. This is all supplemented by you finding piece by piece the in game instruction manual. A manual that has been very carefully crafted to mimic the manuals of games from long ago. Full color illustrations, maps marked up by pen on where to find secrets, notes about what items do. Each time you find a page from the manual a new piece of information about the game is revealed to you. It could be the map of an new area, information about trinkets you have collected that up until this point you were guessing what they might do, or simply just a short piece of the story. From the manual flipping between the pages and the glow of a CRT while consulting it, this in game manual truly captures the experience of what it was like playing a video game in an time long before information was easily accessible.a:[["$","p",null,{"children":[["$","em",null,{"children":"Tunic"}]," is a love letter to the original NES ",["$","em",null,{"children":"Zelda"}]," game.

After progressing a bit further along, you come across a glowing object on the floor. Upon picking it up you are presented with some instructions on how to perform basic actions in the game. In the lower corner a lone number is present. You have the ability to flip this bit of instruction to see some more information about the controls of the game.

The surface level gameplay is a pretty standard isometric action-adventure game with some not to complicated puzzle solving. You explore around a world with areas that are gated off by something you haven't found yet, and as you find items more and more of the world is discoverable. The combat is very simple, but the enemies and bosses can be very tough requiring usually several attempts to fell them.

Some are shown in plain site, some use the isometric nature of the game to hide them, others are behind a totally unassuming wall that you can blow up. The game pushes and rewards you to really scour the various areas. However, it isn't all just combing the overworld. There are puzzles written in the manual made for you to decipher. The game has some hidden spots that are oddly empty that eventually make sense after figuring out what are seemingly random pen scratchings on various pages throughout the manual.
