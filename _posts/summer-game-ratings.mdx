Hello everyone and welcome to another installment of my Tri-annual game review roundups! This is the second in the series of three that I will be doing for the year. Having been busier in the late spring and summer months, my list of games is naturally shorter than my previous set of reviews. Despite having played less games, I still have some heaters lined up and maybe even a surprise hidden up my sleeve.

## The summer of games

Going into the summer I had one major goal: start and finish _Alan Wake 2_. Aside from that I was going to play games mostly by feel. I still have a short backlog of games I plan to finish by the end of the year, however I don't like to force starting them up. I believe being excited to sit down and play a game is important to the experience. I keep a running list of games I intend to play in a rough order I would like to play them, and that list has evolved significantly over the past months. The games I started with in the late spring had a very contrasting tone than one of a bright warm summer.

### Animal Well

The time has finally come that _Animal Well_ has been released to the people. I have been looking forward to this game since its initial launch announcement a couple years ago. I'm not one to get too caught up in the hype of game releases, especially ones announced years in advance, but something about the initial reveal trailer drew me in. A furball walking around a dimly lit world with some spooky animals all in a style where every pixel looks like it was manually placed really spoke to me.

I can't talk about _Animal Well_ without first mentioning the visual style. It is _very_ pretty. A lot of games that take the 8 or 16 bit pixel art approach I usually dismiss as less of a decision and more of "this is how I make something look retro" default. This is very much **not** the case for _Animal Well_. The sprite work is extremely well done and the colour palette gives everything a very somber and moody attitude. The way vines and dangle from ceilings as a series of loosely attached pixels rather than drawn sprites give a sense of mawkishness while not detracting from the mood. Many of the larger creatures dwelling in the well have highly detailed sprites, giving them a greater sense of importance. The creator has also gone on record talking about how there are aspects of the art that are procedurally generated to give a sense of unease to how certain things move. I must say, this definitely comes out and slaps you in the face at some parts.

The use of light in the game is also phenomenally well done. The way certain objects shimmer or illuminate when light hits them makes everything feel a lot more natural and less like static sprites. The light being fully dynamic makes the way you approach hidden nooks and crannies important. The refraction of light off steam and mist make some rooms absolutely gorgeous. While game play and puzzles are not directly impacted by the lighting system, it gives a kind of breath to the game, almost as if it itself is a living character.

The actual moment to moment game play for _Animal Well_ is also very strong and quite enjoyable. It is at its core a 2D exploration based platformer game and follows a lot of the conventional patterns you may find in those games. Something it does very well is treating individual rooms and small portions of the map as a puzzles. Progress is dictated not only from wandering around to find the right wat to go, but solving small but well laid out puzzles. Whether they are isolated to a single room or require you to have a mental map of a handful of rooms, I always felt as if I had something to do or figure out beyond just finding the right way to go.

As for my personal play through experience, I enjoyed my time with the game a lot. The pacing felt perfect and I was never lost. There is almost always at least a single spot in these types of games where I look up where I need to go because I feel as if I've exhausted all my options, and that never happened in my play through. There are a ton of secrets and collectibles and while I wanted to continue searching for them after I finished the game proper, hitting the end and needing to backtrack a full area kinda put me off of wanting to continue. I've looked up some of the more esoteric secrets and easter eggs the game has to offer and there are swaths of secrets that are absolutely insane to not only find, but consider are even hidden there in the first place. This is 100% a game I plan on revisiting and deserves all the love and attention it has gotten.

### Disc Room

This is one of those games that I knew about when it came out, and only played it because I bought it on a massive sale. It's a bullet hell game where you progress through a map of individual rooms populated by buzz-saw discs flying around. Achieving certain objectives in a room unlocks different paths on the map. Objectives can be as simple as "survive for X seconds" or as obtuse as "??? ????? 25 ????". There are a variety of abilities unlocked throughout the game which while helpful, also serve as a means to solving puzzles hidden throughout parts of the map.

Despite having little to no interest in the game on launch, this game hit and it hit hard. I'm not really sure how to explain it, but the game play has an almost addictive quality to it. The game does an excellent job at keeping milestones within rooms feel very achievable, but actually are quite difficult to hit. There are multiple levels of objectives to hit in each room which helps a lot in keeping the pacing of the game feel like you are always progressing. If I ever felt annoyed or frustrated with a room there were always multiple options to move forward with other rooms and paths in the game.

The final aspect of the game I want to touch on is the story. It's nothing groundbreaking, but even having something in a game as simple as this is a welcome addition. It has an air of mystery to it, and after vanquishing the boss of an area you get a little snippet in a comic page set of panels. On top of this there are hidden rooms you can find that have cryptic symbols in them and oddly behaving discs. Puzzling out what needed to be done for these areas led to a _secret_ ending and was quite satisfying to find. _Disc Room_ offers a lot of variety in both action game play and puzzle solving.

### Alan Wake 2

- songs at the end of parts is nice
  - makes the part feel like a wrapped up bundle
- plot board is cool
  - areas having different scenes from different plot points is a really cool idea, even if there aren't many changes
  - each one does contain an echo (vision of some story) that gives it depth
  - don't need each one to be some vast open thing, I like that the different scenes are mostly flavour text
- case board
  - thought was cool at first, got kind of annoying
  - makes you place info of things that have happened or stuff you've seen to organize your thoughts
  - good way to good a bit of extra flavour to the events as the notes are written from the perspective of saga
  - good way to read and remember what has happened in the story
  - good way to backtrack to find info / items you've missed
  - really annoying to drag and drop the things into the correct bucket, feels like a waste of time
- combat while better than 1 isn't really good
  - I do feel less powerful which is a good thing
  - Not knowing if dark entities will be aggressive or not is a great touch to the feeling of tension
- the game is beautiful
- flavour text
  - items not always being simple paper is something I love (main complaint from Control)
  - manuscript pages having parts scratched out and edits made in pen is a great touch
  - the names of streets and words in graffiti are all great
  - silly random things like emails on a computer (fish microwave)
- mind palace
  - really cool idea
  - pretty basic hub, serves more as an interesting menu than a real place
  - I wish I could play the music and still look around the place
- end songs of the chapters I really enjoy
- the overlaps
  - some of my favourite parts
  - third one was my favourite
  - end part it was like a shark was hunting me
  - they do a great job making you scared with mostly environment
  - forests are scary
- connection between saga and wakes stories
  - seeing how the chapters are connecting is really cool
  - the manuscript pages being scratched out to be re-written is cool
- cult stashes
  - at a certain point i didnt care enough to solve the ones that weren't immediately obvious or required me to find a key that wasn't obviously led to, which is a bad thing

### Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition

<Figure

This is one of those games where it feels like the developers dug into your brain and designed something specifically for you. As someone who dabbles in speedrunning, they absolutely nailed both the feel of learning a run as well as the aesthetic of the "I just need a recording of my run" setup. The timer straight up being the LiveSplit timer is just 👌.

Each games set of mini challenges I would say are all pretty well put together. Having the beginner challenges be extremely short 2-5 second segments is not only a great way of easing you into a game, but also does a fantastic job of getting you addicted to push for a lower time. Cutting off 0.08 seconds from my time and going "this was shit I can do better" was a common occurrence.

At first I was pretty bummed out about not having leaderboards available for each of the challenges. It's a very _classic Nintendo_ moment. However, playing a bit post launch I did quickly switch my opinion to be on the side of no leaderboards. Seeing the times that some people had and the strats they used for the online challenge gauntlet led me to believe that having a leaderboard good be discouraging to people. My friends and I set up a spreadsheet of all the levels to have our own makeshift leaderboard though. This likely was also something that quelled my want for a global leaderboard as it was more fun to push to try and beat my friends. Now that we all have slowed down on playing the game, the want for a global leaderboard has crept back in. Seeing that a levels time _could_ be lower is very nice to have. Knowing if your strat has a significant gulf in time compared to ones above is very useful to encourage oneself to explore other strategies or options. Overall I understand why there aren't leaderboards, but I do think that not even including a Switch friends one is a huge misstep.

### Metroid: Zero Mission

- a worthy remake of the original
- very pretty

### Metroid Fusion

- feels quite linear so far
- progressing through the main game can be very cryptic
  - like needing to bomb in a specific area so you can see that you need to speed boost through a specific line without any real indication of that being the way to go
    - or the one spot where you need to kill the worm and then walk all the way to the wall to have the floor crumble beneath you
  - some are telegraphed like you walk in an area below and its blocked off and the area directly above has the same background so it makes sense to try and break the floor
  - it would be nice it regular blaster revealed blocks that needed a special thing to break them, instead of needing to morph ball bomb it to reveal it
- maybe this cryptic progression was done to counteract how direct the path of progression can be?
- first half is a bit boring and straightforward
- some of the boss fights are hard
  - some are very annoying
- ending sequence is awesome
- zero mission makes some minor improvements to gameplay
  - being able to switch between map sub areas
  - post game upgrade reveals are on a per sub area basis
  - space jump timing is no longer extremely restrictive
  - normal shots revealing special blocks as opposed to needing to hit special blocks with a special is so much nicer (doesn't always reveal all though)
- killing enemies respawning if not absorbing the X is cool
  - multiple X combining into a new enemy type is really cool

## Dishonourable mentions

Before I get into the second tri-annual Game of the Third Award&trade;, I want to quickly talk about a couple games that I played, but didn't finish.

### Castlevania: Circle of the Moon

The was the first game I picked up after completing my play through of _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_. I booted it up as it was the only one of the three Game Boy Advance Castlevania games I haven't played, and I was still pretty amped up from _Symphony of the Night_. I gotta say this game stinks. I gave it a couple hours of play time and during all of that did I not once feel any pull to keep playing the game.

<Figure
  title="Map of what I had discovered"

  right
/>

The game was a never ending series of vertical shafts that I platformed up and down through, all sharing a similar platform and enemy layout. Many of the doors you can enter while ascending these vertical rooms lead to a small room with either a health or mana upgrade just sitting for the taking in them. I put in near zero effort to find these upgrades and was given so many I was starting to wonder if they even were having an effect on my stats. Finding what is supposed to be a beneficial upgrade and having the reaction of "ugh not another one" is quite the accomplishment for a game.

The combat, basic enemies, and bosses from what I saw were nothing spectacular. All of it was some pretty expected entry level stuff from a Castlevania game. Rather than equipping new weapons, the game has a system where you can mix and match two cards to apply an effect to your attack. The Dual Set-up System seems like a cool idea but from my brief excursion with the game I only found a total of three different cards. Each of the combinations had a very basic change to my whip that applied an elemental effect which did a bit extra damage to enemies. From what I saw these different elements were resisted by certain enemy types and I can only assume some are more effective as well. Referring to a chart of all the combinations online it seems like other cards do have a greater change to not only your attack but also stat boosts. It would have been fun playing around with this system, but unfortunately it was attached to vertical shaft simulator.

While I can't give _Castlevania: Circle of the Moon_ a fair rating, from what I've played I would not recommend it.

### Downwell

_Downwell_ is a game that I have heard about in passing, but have never tried. It's a fairly neat concept on paper, and combined with the fact that it is unbelievable inexpensive on steam when on sale, I figured why not give it a try. While It certainly is not a _dishonourable_ mention, I didn't end up liking the game very much and made little progress in it after playing for a couple hours.

<PullQuote
  quote="My best runs were often from taking the descent incredibly slow, which felt counterintuitive to how the game wanted me to play."

The level of difficulty is significantly higher than I would have expected going into it. You fall fairly quickly and it can be very hard to react to incoming enemies to either move out of the way or towards them to bounce on their head. As a result I found myself using the gunboots to try and slow my descent. While somewhat effective, the side effect of this was that I would never have ammo for when I actually needed it. Bopping enemies on the head refills ammo, but I would either accidentally kill them or try to hit their head but end up being to slow and slam into them on the side taking damage. My best runs were often from taking the descent incredibly slow, which felt counterintuitive to how the game wanted me to play. I didn't feel like I was getting any better at making progress and when I actually did get further than usual it felt like it was because I was getting lucky.

I played enough to unlock a few of the different game styles, which are modifiers to how the game functions. None of the ones I had unlocked felt like they actually changed game play up at all. The variety of items and power ups I encountered in my runs were fairly limited and were all general upgrades to the player's basic stats. It would have been more enjoyable if there were modifiers to experiment with that changed how the character functioned, but everything was pretty much do this but more now. From a lack of game play variety and difficult that leans into the frustrating side, I couldn't say I would recommend the game.

My winner for the Game of the Third Award™ is _Alan Wake 2_. It probably isn't a surprise considering how much I wrote about the game. Remedy is 2 for 2 for The Game of the Third Award&trade; and I can't wait to play whatever they release next.

## Conclusion

_Animal Well_ was the only game I was waiting for a release of these past few months. It was a welcome and natural follow up after thoroughly enjoying _Symphony of the Night_. I ended up leaning more heavily into the 2D action adventure genre (I shall not say the forbidden word) and frankly had an excellent time with all of the games I played through. It's very reinforcing that it is a favourite genre of mine even though I have not played many games that fall under the categorization of it in the past handful of years.

- something about metroid and castlevania as a series
