## Dishonourable mentions

### Castlevania: Circle of the moon

- literally just vertical rooms with the same platform layout
- theres so many health and mana upgrades in side rooms that are just that, there's like no point to them

### Animal Well

- very pretty and moody
- not having warp out of the end area killed my motivation to continue finding secrets since I didn't want to backtrack

### Disc Room

- bullet hell
- it has an addictive quality to it
  - some rooms feel like you can beat the dev record without much difficulty, but it's actually extremely hard
  - does an excellent job at keeping the game tough but makes attaining certain milestones feel within reach but actually are very difficult to get

### Downwell

-

### Alan Wake 2

- songs at the end of parts is nice
  - makes the part feel like a wrapped up bundle
- plot board is cool
  - areas having different scenes from different plot points is a really cool idea, even if there aren't many changes
  - each one does contain an echo (vision of some story) that gives it depth
  - don't need each one to be some vast open thing, I like that the different scenes are mostly flavour text
- case board
  - thought was cool at first, got kind of annoying
  - makes you place info of things that have happened or stuff you've seen to organize your thoughts
  - good way to good a bit of extra flavour to the events as the notes are written from the perspective of saga
  - good way to read and remember what has happened in the story
  - good way to backtrack to find info / items you've missed
  - really annoying to drag and drop the things into the correct bucket, feels like a waste of time
- combat while better than 1 isn't really good
  - I do feel less powerful which is a good thing
  - Not knowing if dark entities will be aggressive or not is a great touch to the feeling of tension
- the game is beautiful
- flavour text
  - items not always being simple paper is something I love (main complaint from Control)
  - manuscript pages having parts scratched out and edits made in pen is a great touch
  - the names of streets and words in graffiti are all great
  - silly random things like emails on a computer (fish microwave)
- mind palace
  - really cool idea
  - pretty basic hub, serves more as an interesting menu than a real place
  - I wish I could play the music and still look around the place
- end songs of the chapters I really enjoy
- the overlaps
  - some of my favourite parts
  - third one was my favourite
  - end part it was like a shark was hunting me
  - they do a great job making you scared with mostly environment
  - forests are scary
- connection between saga and wakes stories
  - seeing how the chapters are connecting is really cool
  - the manuscript pages being scratched out to be re-written is cool
- cult stashes
  - at a certain point i didnt care enough to solve the ones that weren't immediately obvious or required me to find a key that wasn't obviously led to, which is a bad thing

### Nintendo world championships: NES edition

- Does a good job at easing you into speedrunning by building on really short bits

### Metroid: Zero Mission

- very pretty
