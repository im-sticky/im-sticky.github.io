Hello everyone and welcome to another installment of my Tri-annual game review roundups! This is the second in the series of three that I will be doing for the year. Having been busier in the late spring and summer months, my list of games is naturally shorter than my previous set of reviews. Despite having played less games, I still have some heaters lined up and maybe even a surprise hidden up my sleeve.

## The summer of games

Going into the summer I had one major goal: start and finish _Alan Wake 2_. Aside from that I was going to play games mostly by feel. I still have a short backlog of games I plan to finish by the end of the year, however I don't like to force starting them up. I believe being excited to sit down and play a game is important to the experience. I keep a running list of games I intend to play in a rough order I would like to play them, and that list has evolved significantly over the past months. The games I started with in the late spring had a very contrasting tone than one of a bright warm summer.

### Animal Well

- very pretty and moody
- not having warp out of the end area killed my motivation to continue finding secrets since I didn't want to backtrack

### Disc Room

- bullet hell
- it has an addictive quality to it
  - some rooms feel like you can beat the dev record without much difficulty, but it's actually extremely hard
  - does an excellent job at keeping the game tough but makes attaining certain milestones feel within reach but actually are very difficult to get

### Downwell

- didn't actually beat it
  - gave up from combination of difficulty and not liking it enough
- pretty difficult
- moving downward is pretty fast, it can be quite difficult to react to incoming enemies
- I never felt like I got better at progressing and that when I was progressing I as getting lucky
- I would do better going as slow as I could but the game feels like it wants you to push down quickly
- it wants me to combo off of enemies but doing so always result in accidentally hits since things appear so quickly
- I did not like a lot of the different guns or styles

### Alan Wake 2

- songs at the end of parts is nice
  - makes the part feel like a wrapped up bundle
- plot board is cool
  - areas having different scenes from different plot points is a really cool idea, even if there aren't many changes
  - each one does contain an echo (vision of some story) that gives it depth
  - don't need each one to be some vast open thing, I like that the different scenes are mostly flavour text
- case board
  - thought was cool at first, got kind of annoying
  - makes you place info of things that have happened or stuff you've seen to organize your thoughts
  - good way to good a bit of extra flavour to the events as the notes are written from the perspective of saga
  - good way to read and remember what has happened in the story
  - good way to backtrack to find info / items you've missed
  - really annoying to drag and drop the things into the correct bucket, feels like a waste of time
- combat while better than 1 isn't really good
  - I do feel less powerful which is a good thing
  - Not knowing if dark entities will be aggressive or not is a great touch to the feeling of tension
- the game is beautiful
- flavour text
  - items not always being simple paper is something I love (main complaint from Control)
  - manuscript pages having parts scratched out and edits made in pen is a great touch
  - the names of streets and words in graffiti are all great
  - silly random things like emails on a computer (fish microwave)
- mind palace
  - really cool idea
  - pretty basic hub, serves more as an interesting menu than a real place
  - I wish I could play the music and still look around the place
- end songs of the chapters I really enjoy
- the overlaps
  - some of my favourite parts
  - third one was my favourite
  - end part it was like a shark was hunting me
  - they do a great job making you scared with mostly environment
  - forests are scary
- connection between saga and wakes stories
  - seeing how the chapters are connecting is really cool
  - the manuscript pages being scratched out to be re-written is cool
- cult stashes
  - at a certain point i didnt care enough to solve the ones that weren't immediately obvious or required me to find a key that wasn't obviously led to, which is a bad thing

### Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition

- Does a good job at easing you into speedrunning by building on really short bits

### Metroid: Zero Mission

- very pretty

### Metroid Fusion

- feels quite linear so far
- progressing through the main game can be very cryptic
  - like needing to bomb in a specific area so you can see that you need to speed boost through a specific line without any real indication of that being the way to go
    - or the one spot where you need to kill the worm and then walk all the way to the wall to have the floor crumble beneath you
  - some are telegraphed like you walk in an area below and its blocked off and the area directly above has the same background so it makes sense to try and break the floor
  - it would be nice it regular blaster revealed blocks that needed a special thing to break them, instead of needing to morph ball bomb it to reveal it
- maybe this cryptic progression was done to counteract how direct the path of progression can be?
- first half is a bit boring and straightforward
- some of the boss fights are hard
  - some are very annoying
- ending sequence is awesome
- zero mission makes some minor improvements to gameplay
  - being able to switch between map sub areas
  - post game upgrade reveals are on a per sub area basis
  - space jump timing is no longer extremely restrictive
  - normal shots revealing special blocks as opposed to needing to hit special blocks with a special is so much nicer (doesn't always reveal all though)
- killing enemies respawning if not absorbing the X is cool
  - multiple X combining into a new enemy type is really cool

## Dishonourable mentions

### Castlevania: Circle of the Moon

- literally just vertical rooms with the same platform layout
- theres so many health and mana upgrades in side rooms that are just that, there's like no point to them

## The Game of the Third Award&trade;

The nominees are:

My winner for the Game of the Third Awardâ„¢ is _Alan Wake 2_. It probably isn't a surprise considering how much I wrote about the game. Remedy is 2 for 2 for The Game of the Third Award&trade; and I can't wait to play whatever they release next.

## Conclusion

_Animal Well_ was the only game I was waiting for a release of these past months. It was a welcome and natural follow up after having played through and thoroughly enjoying _Symphony of the Night_. I ended up leaning more heavily into the 2D action adventure genre (I shall not say the forbidden word) and frankly had an excellent time with all of the games. It's very reinforcing that it is a favourite genre of mine even though I have not played many games that fall under the categorization of it in the past handful of years.

- something about metroid and castlevania as a series
