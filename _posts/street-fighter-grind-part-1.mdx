My friends and I entered to compete in _Street Fighter 6_ at Combo Breaker this year at the end of May. I'm pretty ass at _Street Fighter 6_ but I love competing and like to take it seriously. As a part of my grind to become not so ass at the game, I'm going to post some write ups on things I'm working on, things I need to improve on, general training regimes, anything related to the game to give myself some sort of accountability on my improvement.

## Where I'm at

First things first, how I feel with where I'm "starting at". I played a decent amount last year but was pretty bad and never felt comfortable using my character. I can say reasonably confidently now that I'm comfortable with all my inputs and movement. I no longer struggle with getting inputs I intend to out and have some reasonable combos and punishes that I can rely on. Of course I still mess stuff up and don't have a perfect success rate with inputs, but I'm at a point where that no longer frustrates me mid game.

Currently I've spent a lot of time in casual matches just trying to become more comfortable with using guile and getting used to capitalizing on openings and keep a game plan against people. I've been trying to force use of different things in the games to see how and when things work and when they would make sense. I've been playing a minimum of 30 minutes every day (and intend to continue until Combo Breaker), wether it's training mode, combo trials, or matches. I also keep it to a max of 60-90 minutes each day as to keep the play more focused on active improvement and not mindless play.

Currently I'm working on:

- using less CMK when in close range (it's slow and no special cancel)
  - use CLK instead if I want to hit low, CMP so I can special cancel
- stop DIing people who are jumping in
  - even when not charged I have good CHP reactions, not sure how I formed this habit
- buffering DR when using MP/HP in neutral
- stop trying to re-adjust by back walking when in close range (I keep getting clipped by random lows)
- don't always use the highest level super to punish when I can kill with something else

Things I plan to start working on:

- using training mode for punish / anti-air / whatever routines
- using parry at all
- drive rush to close distance more

These lists aren't exhaustive but they're bigger things that I'm more aware of and know are giving me big gaps in my game.

## Future updates

I'm not playing a ton of ranked right now, but I would like to post a new one of these every time I rank up (currently Platinum 1). Hopefully that ends up being more than a couple times. I'll still post check ins outside of that but try to keep them a little more infrequent so I have things to talk about.

Stay frosty
