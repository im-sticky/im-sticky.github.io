## Shorter days and longer nights

Something about the days getting shorter and colder gives me an urge to hunker down and play video games. Hunkering down, getting comfy, and playing games on a CRT is the exact vibe I want when the nights start earlier. Something about that and the cold air gives me a sort of nostalgic feel for video games. Maybe it's because I spent so much time as a kid playing games in the basement. Regardless, the games this winter had some heat to them.

### Pseudoregalia

I played this game purely on the fact that a friend made me aware that it even existed. I had never heard of it before and during my time with talking about the Metroid games I had played during the summer, a friend sent me a link to the Steam store page for this. It seemed cool enough and I was already on a kick with these style of games, so I added it to my wishlist with the intent of one day buying it at a discount. Funnily enough like one or two days later it went on enough a sale that I figured nows as good a time as any.

_Pseudoregalia_ is a 3D action adventure platformer designed and styled to look and feel like something you would have bought for the original Playstation. It has that sort of smooth, blocky, kind of goofy look and feel you would get from a Spyro or Croc. And of course it stars a furry, like so many games of that generation. I'm not sure if this is a common sentiment, but It has a sense of almost loneliness those kinds of games make me feel. Other games of this era (not exclusive to the Playstation) also evoke this feeling in me. _Glover_ is the prime example of this for me. I'm not totally certain how to quantify it and it may seem a bit odd to others, but I'm sure some of you will understand what I mean.

- cool world to explore
  - cool to try and get to places where it feels like you shouldn't be able to get to yet (using various movement abilities)
- after getting a few abilities movement is quite fun
- combat is meh / not a lot of enemies
- fun platforming challenges for bonus outfits
- the game used to not have a map
  - talk about how picked it up conveniently shortly after the map update (about a year? after release)
  - probably wouldn't have finished the game without a map (would need to have done it over a couple days and even then would probably still get stuck)

### The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom

- issues
  - echoes UI
  - lack of collectables makes exploring not always feel worth it
  - smoothies are an ok idea but obnoxious to make
  - puzzles can often just be solved by summon 5 beds
  - the hold ability is a bit weird, always forget that I have it (for when you need it for puzzles)
    - it feels like its tacked on?
  - echoes should be fleshed out better
    - better AI / attack more often
    - being able to turn into link and fight is kinda dumb
      - it's zelda's adventure to find link, why eschew that and have her turn into link, it makes it feel like she can't hold her own and you still need link to do thesaving
      - it's just way better than echoes to kill things since echoes can be painfully slow to do basic tasks
      - maybe rebalance how many you can summon to reflect this
- still kinda fun

### Alan Wake 2: Night Springs & The Lake House

Including DLC in full game reviews may seem a bit odd, but I felt that it would be a shame to not include them.

### Rivals of Aether 2

Another strange inclusion as this is an almost exclusively multiplayer game, but one that I want to talk about. I was a huge _Rivals of Aether_ fan and absolutely loved playing the game. Well, to be exact I loved playing Wrastor. I exclusively played him and to this day he is my all time favourite fighting game character I have had the pleasure of maining.

- issues with UI
- issues
  - button check
  - in game tutorials
    - theres links to resources for mechanics and characters but it was nice being in the game
  - things looking a bit lackluster and menus feel a bit meh
  - rank not being character dependant
  - no way to see what leveling up unlocks
  - no way to equip some cosmetics outside of the character select screen
  - no native GCC support
- most of these things can be fixed (but will they) post launch
  - but it's a bit disappointing the game did launch and it feels like it's still a beta outside of gameplay
- gameplay
  - feels good
  - balance is a bit whack right now
- personally I feel like it has lost it's identity of being rivals of aether with the addition of all the "standard" smash mechanics

### The Quarry

This game fucking rules. In my younger days I admittedly was a hater of _Until Dawn_ and the idea of a game essentially being a movie with quick time events. As time has passed on I slowly flipped on my opinion and have greatly enjoyed participating in past entries of Supermassive's library. There is definitely a lot of fun to be had with a story you get to influence, even if the gameplay is extremely basic.

While this is not something that only I per se played, or technically even finished, I want to add it to this list since it is something I have now "played" and have watched a full play through of. Due to the nature of how the game is played, I feel I can pretty fairly pass judgement on it. I also really just want to talk about it since _The Quarry_ genuinely has such a fun story and I wanna talk about how silly it is.

- fun group activity
- game is actually so fun
- despite the gameplay literally being barely walking, picking 1 of 2 choices, and QTEs, it's quite fun
  - the extreme simplicity of the gameplay doesn't actually detract a lot
  - it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more
- the ratings would be very different had I played this game by myself

- cool
- love the sound effects
- the leveling and item system is pretty interesting
  - feel like more consumables should drop to encourage more item variety?
- gets pretty tough
- like the idea of the horseback levels, find them a bit awkward but it may have been me sucking
- variety in enemies is reasonably high
- love the environments
  - the diorama esque style is fantastic
  - the super low resolution style of character and enemies actually works in it really well, feels like a papercraft box

### Alan Wake's American Nightmare

After finding a link to a <ExternalLink href="https://thishouseofdreams.blogspot.com/?m=1">blog</ExternalLink> referenced by some correspondence found on Dr. Marmont's desk in _The Lake House_, I tried going to the blog and unsurprisingly to me, was a real blog. I read through the posts and being confused about the dates of them being so far in the past delved deeper into what the blog was. I found that it was written and released by Remedy alongside the release of _American Nightmare_. Reading through the blog entries and knowing that story elements in _Control_ and _Alan Wake 2_ were ideas conceptualized from this blog is one of the coolest things to me. Having such a strong foundation of ideas so far in advance of the release of those games is truly a mark of a great artist in my eyes. If you're familiar with the story of _Control_ and _Alan Wake_, I would recommend checking out the <ExternalLink href="https://thishouseofdreams.blogspot.com/?m=1">blog</ExternalLink>.

<PullQuote quote="I almost wish I hadn't played this game." right />

All that being said, I almost wish I hadn't played this game. If you have read my previous entries in this game review series you know by now that I have been absolutely nerding out over _Control_ and the _Alan Wake_ series. It would make sense to want to finish up the games I haven't played within the extended universe. And while I'm happy I have more context into the story and characters, particularly in regards to <AudioTrigger filePath="/assets/mr-scratch.mp3" style={{position: 'relative'}}>Mr.&nbsp;Scratch <img src="/assets/scratch.png" style={{position: 'absolute', top: '-1px', right: '-2px', height: '105%'}} /></AudioTrigger>, it is so poorly written and so surface level that it doesn't feel like a Remedy game at all.

<Figure
  image="winter-game-reviews/american-nightmare-manuscript.jpg"
  caption="Example of a manuscript page"
  right
/>

The manuscript pages feel out of place here. In the other Alan Wake games they often are used as breadcrumbs to show you a path of things that have yet to come. In _American Nightmare_ a good chunk of them are exposition explaining to you what has happened in the 2 years that have elapsed between now and the first game. The pages are also randomly strewn throughout the "open world" for you to find rather than along the generally linear path of the other games. It changes them from feeling that of a page specifically placed for your character to find to that of a book happened to explode 300 feet above the area you're in.

The writing also felt quite weak. Now, it is not totally fair to be comparing the writing in this game to the writing in _Alan Wake 2_ so I'll hold my tongue on that. But in comparison to _Alan Wake 1_? While sometimes a bit corny, it had a very strong story, well written characters with good motivations and dialogue, and a strong sense of self. This one feels like a total precursor to it on the quality front, **especially** the character dialogue. I really don't want to bash on it that much as I truly am a fan of Sam Lake. He is an excellent writer and is genuinely a role model for me creatively. It just feels like the contents of this game could've been an email.

Ok, enough about the not game part of the game. The gameplay itself is mediocre at best. They pivoted to a more arcade action style of game compared to _Alan Wake_'s survival action-esque gameplay. They really aren't that far apart in how they play, but as opposed to the need to consistently find resources to combat the enemies in the first game _American Nightmare_ just pours them all ove you. You have access to health and ammo pretty much at all times whenever you want as caches that totally replenish your resources are everywhere. There are a fair number of enemies so I get the sense that they want you to feel very strong killing off a ton of guys, but on the standard difficulty they are so unbelievably easy to deal with that a horde of them never really felt like a big deal. The arcade shooter combat was also exasperated by the fact that some of the guns you unlocked were heavy weaponry that felt like they belonged in a modern _Call of Duty_ game. I won't say I didn't have fun with some of the weapons unlocked later in the game, but it just wasn't what I expected or wanted.

It may sound like I hate this game, but I don't. I'm just disappointed in it. Again, it is **very** unfair to expect the quality of games that came **years** after it. I'm glad I didn't play this immediately after the first game because it definitely would've put me off wanting to continue with the series for a bit. While the story as a whole may have been mediocre, the foundation of ideas in it are pretty good. Learning about <AudioTrigger filePath="/assets/mr-scratch.mp3" style={{position: 'relative'}}>Mr.&nbsp;Scratch <img src="/assets/scratch.png" style={{position: 'absolute', top: '-1px', right: '-2px', height: '105%'}} /></AudioTrigger> and all his machinations was fun enough. His performance and his video segments were solid as usual. The concept of <Spoiler inline>the dark place being a loop</Spoiler> is introduced in this game which honestly I'm glad I didn't know before going into _Alan Wake 2_. I feel parts of that game would have less impact having known that.

Well, that was a bit long winded. I knew going in that it would be weaker than other entries in the series, but having totally bought into the universe I thought I would still look onto the game with starry-eyed wonderment. I was wrong. This game sucks. There definitely are bits of good in it and I will say I'm glad having beaten it (thankfully it's fairly short). I likely will foray into the realm of _Quantum Break_ at some point in the future. I'm not 100% certain how connected if at all it is to Remedy's extended universe, but at this point I'm sure there will be something there.

### Path of Exile 2

Many moons ago, _Path of Exile_ was the only video game I would even think about. I played so much of it and absolutely loved it. It was one of the defining pillars of my college life. In recent years I haven't even kept up with what was going on with it, but a huge part of why I stopped was that I disliked the direction the game had started to go. It had become so much faster and harder to understand what the fuck was going on. There were so many league mechanics that had made their way into the main game that had just kept compounding on one another until it was impossible to know what you actually had to do to for different kinds of loot. Although I know it's become and remained **extremely** popular, so my opinion must be in the minority. Nevertheless, _Path of Exile 2_ seemed to promise to be the game speed and complexity reset that my friends and I had been waiting for.

Let me start of by saying, never ever listen to anyone on the internet ever. After I got to about mid act 3 of constant playing, I went to reddit to see if people were posting about sweet builds or items they had found. Obviously this was a mistake and it was nothing but absolute bitching and moaning about the game. Complaints which I pretty much disagree with (except one which we'll discuss later). I miss the good old days of when something I liked was very niche and forums were basically only filled with people who enjoyed the thing and wanted to actively participate with others who enjoy it.

<PullQuote quote="Internet hate goblins aside, the game is very good." right />

Internet hate goblins aside, the game is very good. It is in early access so things can and will change a lot, but so far the direction they're going in is great. It has a lot of the charm that _Path of Exile_ did when it first came out in early access. While Grinding Gear Games intends to have 6 full acts on launch, it currently only has 3 complete ones. You need to replay through the 3 acts again in "cruel" difficulty. I'm actually a fan of this since it's a pretty ARPG thing to do, so I have enjoyed the time redoing all the acts.

What I'm not enjoying about the acts right now is how brutally long they can be. Act 1 feels great, not too long and the zones are reasonably sized. It feels inline with OG _Path of Exile_. Act 2 is a decent bit longer, but has a non-linearity portion of it which was a nice change of pace. The zones start to get bigger as you progress and the last few zones feel pretty huge. Act 3 literally feels like it never ends. Many of the zones are massive mazes which can make going the wrong direction feel miserable. The game even baits you into thinking the act is about to finish by the last visible zone on the map ending up revealing an entire second portion of the map. It genuinely feels like it isn't going to end.

This is the one point from the internet goblin army of complainers that I actually wholly agree with on. The campaign doesn't feel as snappy as it should, especially in a game that is about building and experimenting with a lot of different characters and items. As of now I don't feel particularly strongly on wanting to level up a new character since chunks of the game are such a slog to get through. GGG did boast about how long the actual campaign was in the lead up to launch, so we do know this is by design. Unfortunately, what they may have seen as content to play through actually just ended up feeling like stretching what they had.

Most other differences between 1 and 2 are generally a net positive in my eyes. The game is quite different from the first and itemization, passive tree, and gem selection feel fairly well made. Gone are the days where you plan your passive tree around traveling between life nodes. This makes clusters of notable nodes feel more impactful while leveling. I would say the passive tree still needs some tuning to make traveling around it feel less like you're wasting nodes on simple connectors, but again this can and will change given GGG's track record. I'm also a huge fan to the changes in currency. I'm actually using what I find to upgrade my gear rather then hoarding what I find and hoping currency that lets me use my skills drop. I haven't made it to the endgame yet so I can't comment on that yet, but any avid _Path of Exile_ fan knows that's where the real meat of the game.

I've greatly enjoyed my time with the game so far and have dumped a lot of time into it so far. I think about items to get and where to go in my skill tree next a decent bit which is a good sign. The game is definitely tickling my brain in the right way. There are a ton of skills, classes, acts, and probably reworks that are coming to the game before and on full release. I think it has a bright future and I'm looking forward to it.

My winner for the Game of the Third Award™ is _Alan Wake 2: Night Springs & The Lake House_. It feels like a bit of a cop out not only choosing DLC expansions as my Game of the Third Award™ winner, but also another Remedy game. But what can I say, _The Lake House_ was a fantastic expansion and the set of games this time around weren't particularly strong.

</Spoiler>

## Conclusion

I played more games than I expected to for this third. Generally the majority of my winter game playing would be closer to the holidays when going out to socialize and do things is at a yearly low. Although, this was definitely the weakest set of games **by far**. Even though I poorly rated several games, I do think there was a lot to discuss and found them interesting to write about. Not every game can be a home run slam dunk.

I will be releasing a Game of the Three Thirds Award&trade; edition soon, so stay tuned for that.
