I wanted to wait on giving immortality a review / recommendation because it's kind of meaty and I wanted to chew on it a bit before calling it steak or gristle. 

TLDR: I would give it a soft recommendation with the expectation that it is artsy so your headspace/mood would affect your enjoyment.

So I foud the game to be gratuitous, pretentious, tedious, and extremely intriguing. My feelings on each of these fluctuated greatly as I was going through it. I wouldn't really peg any of those as a negative after going through all of the game, and looking up some info on the story that I missed. Which brings me to the thing on the story and gameplay. I won't consider this a spoiler since you played a little bit, but due to the nature of how you explore the story you get it in a non linear order you can miss key information when you hit the end point. I had a pretty good grasp on everything except after looking up the story in it's entirety I missed 2 and a half  key pieces of information that would have made the ending a lot cooler. It's something I could have and sort of interpreted, but there was still an air of mystery around what was going on exactly. While that sounds like it could be a positive I feel like if I had known those things the end would have been more powerful.

Speaking to that point, the gameplay I found to be really cool, at first. I'm a huge sucker for mixed media and I just wanna shout out that title screen, it's so fucking cool. Anyways, I was glued to the screen for the first 5 or so hours. Something happened after a couple hours that really got me into it and I couldn't stop playing because I was so curious as to what was going on. Having a couple goals of things I wanted to find out helped me stay so invested.

Now, the bad part. I'm gonna spoiler this just in case but I'm going to keep it actual spoiler free, I just need to talk about a mechanic in the game.

|| The whole mechanic of discovering new clips is quite cool, but gets omega tedious after I hit a certain threshold in the game. So picking items and people bring you to from what I can tell to a totally random clip assigned to the same category of that object (eg, glass, painting, specific person). So in the begining everything you find is new, and part of the charm is trying new things thinking if that would be assigned to something. However, this after a while starts to get really annoying, because you start cycling through clips you've already seen, and you have no idea if you can find a new clip by clicking on those things. This led to me to stop trying certain things cause I thought I was locked into a set of clips but after going back to the game after looking some things up I was able to get to some important scenes I missed by clicking on random things for like 5 mins. Another thing that adds to the tedium is not knowing if you should watch something all the way through or just scrub through more quickly. It's a lot of footage so after a couple hours of watching it I would speed some things up if I thought it wasn't important to the story which ended up biting me a couple times. So I would end up going back to some things. BUT I think this isn't entirely a fault of the game and partially by design, there needs to be fluff and you finding the meat is definitely a part of it, which I don't think is for everyone. I found the actual footage of some of the movies mostly interesting enough. Anyways, from the nature of the gameplay when I hit the end point I had missed some key info that I definitely would have liked to see before the end, I feel like knowing the important stuff is a huge plus. Although, you don't know what is necessarily important until you are shown things so it kinda sucks in that regard. ||

So, my real answer on if the game is worth playing or not. I would say while good, interesting, and quite cool, your milage might vary. It's kind of a copout answer but imo I hit a key point at a pretty well timed  point into my hours played (it was maybe just after 2 - 2.5 hours in). I would say if you're really curious after this, do 1 play session for at least 3 hours and if you never hit something and go oh shit stop, and ask me for a hint of you are still curious about it. It took me just over 9 hours to beat it and another 30 mins of looking things up to get everything I needed outside the game.

To speak to the point of calling the game gratuitous and pretentious, the gratuitousness is kinda of eye rolling but it is a little necessary due to the main mechanic of navigating the clips. The pretentiousness about 1/2 to 2/3rds in felt like c'mon guys I get it this is art, BUT after completely the game I totally understand why it feels like that spoiler ||it's intentional||.

Also quick note on the controls. I never found them difficult to work with, maybe messy at the begining but never really struggled. I looked at steam reviews and that seems to be a common complaint. One thing I did use was the triggers for scrubbing through footage which I don't think it mentions in the intro, which I used exclusively after I found that out. 

Ok this turned into a whole ass thing, I quickly read through it once cause it's so long. I guess the amount I wrote on it is also a good indicator on how worth it is.
