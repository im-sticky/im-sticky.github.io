## Shorter days and longer nights

Something about the days getting shorter and colder gives me an urge to hunker down and play video games. Hunkering down, getting comfy, and playing games on a CRT is the exact vibe I want when the nights start earlier. Something about that and the cold air gives me a sort of nostalgic feel for video games. Maybe it's because I spent so much time as a kid playing games in the basement. Regardless, the games this winter had some heat to them.

### Pseudoregalia

I played this game purely on the fact that a friend made me aware that it even existed. I had never heard of it before and during my time with talking about the Metroid games I had played during the summer, a friend sent me a link to the Steam store page for this. It seemed cool enough and I was already on a kick with these style of games, so I added it to my wishlist with the intent of one day buying it at a discount. Funnily enough like one or two days later it went on enough a sale that I figured nows as good a time as any.

_Pseudoregalia_ is a 3D furry action adventure platformer designed and styled to look and feel like something you would have bought for the original Playstation. It has that sort of smooth blocky kind of goofy feel you would get from Spyro or Croc. I'm not sure if this is a common sentiment, but It has that sense of almost loneliness that those games makes me feel. The worlds feel like they're actually from some civilization that is long past. Other games of this era not, exclusive to the Playstation, also evoked this feeling in me. _Glover_ on the N64 for example. It's a bit of an odd thing to say I feel, but maybe others feel the same way.

- cool world to explore
  - cool to try and get to places where it feels like you shouldn't be able to get to yet (using various movement abilities)
- after getting a few abilities movement is quite fun
- combat is meh / not a lot of enemies
- fun platforming challenges for bonus outfits
- the game used to not have a map
  - talk about how picked it up conveniently shortly after the map update (about a year? after release)
  - probably wouldn't have finished the game without a map (would need to have done it over a couple days and even then would probably still get stuck)

### The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom

- issues
  - echoes UI
  - lack of collectables makes exploring not always feel worth it
  - smoothies are an ok idea but obnoxious to make
  - puzzles can often just be solved by summon 5 beds
  - the hold ability is a bit weird, always forget that I have it (for when you need it for puzzles)
    - it feels like its tacked on?
  - echoes should be fleshed out better
    - better AI / attack more often
    - being able to turn into link and fight is kinda dumb
      - it's zelda's adventure to find link, why eschew that and have her turn into link, it makes it feel like she can't hold her own and you still need link to do thesaving
      - it's just way better than echoes to kill things since echoes can be painfully slow to do basic tasks
      - maybe rebalance how many you can summon to reflect this
- still kinda fun

### Alan Wake 2: Night Springs & The Lake House

Including DLC in full game reviews may seem a bit odd, but I felt that it would be a shame to not include them.

### Rivals of Aether 2

Another strange inclusion as this is an almost exclusively multiplayer game, but one that I want to talk about. I was a huge _Rivals of Aether_ fan and absolutely loved playing the game. Well, to be exact I loved playing Wrastor. I exclusively played him and to this day he is my all time favourite fighting game character I have had the pleasure of maining.

- issues with UI
- issues
  - button check
  - in game tutorials
    - theres links to resources for mechanics and characters but it was nice being in the game
  - things looking a bit lackluster and menus feel a bit meh
  - rank not being character dependant
  - no way to see what leveling up unlocks
  - no way to equip some cosmetics outside of the character select screen
  - no native GCC support
- most of these things can be fixed (but will they) post launch
  - but it's a bit disappointing the game did launch and it feels like it's still a beta outside of gameplay
- gameplay
  - feels good
  - balance is a bit whack right now
- personally I feel like it has lost it's identity of being rivals of aether with the addition of all the "standard" smash mechanics

### The Quarry

- fun group activity
- game is actually so fun
- despite the gameplay literally being barely walking, picking 1 of 2 choices, and QTEs, it's quite fun
  - the extreme simplicity of the gameplay doesn't actually detract a lot
  - it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything more
- the ratings would be very different had I played this game by myself
