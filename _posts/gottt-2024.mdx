## Game roundup retrospective

I played a lot of different games this year, which is actually kind of unusual for me. I'm not one to play a little of many different games, but generally a lot of few individual games. That being said, I had a great time not only playing all of the games I did this year, but also writing my mini reviews / summaries for of all them. I put a lot of time and effort into both writing the posts and also improvements to the actual blog itself. I learned a lot about how I write, how I want to be able to write, and when is too much. I definitely struggled with the "too much" aspect of these posts. In the future I plan on putting more effort into keeping these more bite sized and general. I put far too many specific details into some of my summaries and ended up leaning to heavily into critical reviews rather than approachable bite sized summaries.

Anyways, lets get into the awards!
