I have had good progress with my speedrunning journey so far. I have had less practice in the past couple weeks than I would like to have had due to other commitments, but the practice I have had has been good practice. I've learned chapter 6 and have been refining my strategies for the previous chapters. I have even been doing dry runs of the first 5 to 6 chapters all the way through and have been hitting fairly consistent times that project to roughly a 50 minute total time. Everything has been going great so far.

However, in my the early stages of learning the chapter 7 route, I have hit a bit of a wall. I am used to repeatedly dying and pushing myself through to learn the screens of a chapter, but for some reason chapter 7 has been particularly difficult. I'm not entirely sure why I have been struggling so much more, but the process has been much harder for me and it feels like I'm not getting anywhere really.

I feel like potentially it could be that I'm anxious to start getting into full runs. It's been quite a while now and I don't actually have a full run time to my name yet. The last chapter is the last step before I can start actually doing runs, so there is definitely a bit more pressure there to hurry up and finish learning it. Another factor I think amy be at play is the fact that the chapter you have multiple dashes to work with. More dashes equals more opportunities for faster strats, which in turn is more opportunity to mess up. I really need to try and keep things a bit simpler and avoid feeling the need to learn fast strats throughout the entire chapter.

This process has made me look a bit inward on my ability to apply myself and learn a totally new skill. It has been fun but it also has been a bit nerve wracking. This is something that I have a deadline to refine before I need to perform in front of a bunch of people. That external force has not been affecting my practice yet, but the closer we get to February to more it will. The goal is still to have a reasonable run by the end of the year. With the holidays coming up I will still be fairly busy with other things and while I feel on target to accomplish that, I may not hit the goal as comfortably as I hope to.

Thanks for reading.
