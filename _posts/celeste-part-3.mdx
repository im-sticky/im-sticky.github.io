### I did it!

I set a goal for myself to start doing full speedruns of Celeste by the end of the year with a target time of 50 minutes, and I'm happy to say that I have accomplished that goal. My very first full run was just under that by about 15 seconds, and the next few runs were all on the 50:XX mark. The main thing I've learned is that a full run with all the chapters is _extremely_ tiring. Most of my runs have silly deaths and mistakes in places that I basically never died at in practice, but even with those errors I'm consistently hitting the 50 minute mark.

### What's next

Right now I don't have a hard goal, but I believe I can push my time down to 45 minutes with my current strats. I need a lot more practice in the last 2 chapters. I'm not very confident in those chapters and it shows while doing runs. With a few less deaths and some more consistent strats, I can definitely achieve a 45 minute time. In the future I may start looking to learning some faster room optimization to try and push it further, but for now I'm happy with what I&nbsp;have.
