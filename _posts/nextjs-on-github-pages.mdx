_Vercel has an <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/main/examples/github-pages">official example</ExternalLink> for deploying to GitHub Pages. Look at this as well to make an informed decision on what strategy works best for you._

My original setup for hosting a static <ExternalLink href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</ExternalLink> site on <ExternalLink href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</ExternalLink> was made using a blog post that unfortunately no longer exists. So here is a guide for what I have now.

## Configure Next.js

> ðŸ“¢ This guide is using Next.js version 14 using app router.

In your `next.config.js` file add the following:

```
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  // Any other config options
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

In your `/app/layout.tsx` file add the following at the bottom of the file:

```
export const dynamic = 'force-static';
```

Lastly add a blank `.nojekyll` file in the `/public/` folder to disable GitHub Pages from trying to create a Jekyll website.

## Setup GitHub repository

Configure your repo for automating deployments.

### Enable GitHub Pages

To enable Pages in your GitHub repo:

1. Create and push a **gh-pages**
2. Go to **Settings -> Pages**
3. Set the **Build and deployment -> Source** to **Deploy from a branch**
4. Set the branch to **gh-pages**
5. Set the folder to **/ (root)**
6. Save

### Generate deploy keys

For <ExternalLink href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</ExternalLink> to commit and push to the `gh-pages` branch you need to generate public and private keys for it to authenticate.

In your Next.js root directory run the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "$(git config user.email)" -f gh-pages -N ""
```

### Setup deploy key

In your GitHub repo:

1. Go to **Settings -> Deploy Keys**
2. Click **Add deploy key**
3. Add title: **Public key of ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY**
4. Add key: _copy and paste the public key you just generated_
5. Check: Allow write access
6. Add key

### Setup private key

In your GitHub repo:

1. Go to **Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Add name: **ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY**
4. Add secret: _copy and paste the private key you just generated_
5. Add secret

Now GitHub Actions is able to authenticate with your repo. Delete the two keys from your Next.js root directory. **Do not commit or share those files with anyone.**

## Setup GitHub Actions

Add a workflow file `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```
name: Deploy to Github Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.5

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4.0.2
        with:
          node-version: 'lts/*'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm i
          npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
          publish_dir: ./out
```

## Enjoy your site

You're done! Now whenever you push to the `main` branch your site will automatically build and deploy and be publicly available at `repo-name.github.io`.
