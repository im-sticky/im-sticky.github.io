Welcome back to another development log of my game. Aside from fighting with the Godot editor, I have been having a positive experience with the engine itself. It's docs are good enough to be able to get by mostly on my own. The questions & answers available on their forums as well videos people put out on youtube are all great and incredibly helpful. I have to say I'm quite happy with it so far (aside from my editor woes).

## Game updates

This iteration has a laundry list of updates. A lot of background invisible updates to my system for managing player and hitbox states, as well as a lot of basic features you would expect to find in a fighting game.

Features of this version in no particular order:

- Variable jump heights
- Disallow movement when performing an attack
- Add hitbox hitstop
- Handle directional inputs for attacks
- Migrate hitbox state to individual nodes
- Hook player health into UI element
- Add different sprites for player states
- Continue hitboxes where they left off after experiencing hitstop
- Make hitstop halt player momentum in air
- Various players states and transitions between them
- Formula for calculating launch speed and hitstun
- Adjustable gravity / weight / ground speed / air speed / dash speed
- Fix launch vector sudden stop
- Add double jump
- Add aerial attack landing cancelling and end lag
