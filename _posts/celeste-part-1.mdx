I love Celeste. Over time it has grown to become my favourite game ever, _probably_. It blends a simple relatable story with gameplay and mechanics that I enjoy so so much. It's challenging and requires you to fail and learn to be able move forward, but is fair and never asks too much from you. I could write about this game all day long, but the real reason I have decided to write about it is because I have started to learn how to speedrun through the game.

- my speedrunning in the past and relation to it
- KGDQ
- ive always wanted to learn celeste but was scared
  - its sick
  - its raw skill
- deciding to try and setting goals
- the initial process
- my progress and examples
  - making my own strats
  - finding my own skips!
