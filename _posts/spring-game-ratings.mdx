Hello and welcome to a set of short and sweet reviews on the games I have played so far in 2024 (really starting from my Christmas break in 2023). I want to do this for all the games I was planning on playing throughout the year, and I still intend to, but waiting until the very end of the year to do this would result in a massive list, and I don't want to wait a full year to write about these games. So I decided to do 3 times in the year, a sort of seasonal approach (yes I am aware there are 4 seasons but fall barely exists in Toronto).

## Ratings breakdown

A quick explainer of how my ratings work. A couple years ago I made a small website called <ExternalLink href="https://gamerater.vercel.app/">Game Rater</ExternalLink> that makes small sharable images for game reviews in the style of GamePro magazine. Each category goes from 1 to 5 (5 being the best) and encompasses a handful of elements rather than strictly what the title of it is. What each numerical rating can equate to for me personally can be found on the legend image <span className="desktop-only">to the right</span><span className="mobile-only">above</span>.

For the ratings themselves, 2.5 is a baseline for what I would consider "fair", meaning it isn't _really_ bad but it's definitely not _good_. It's kind of _meh_ and could swing in either a good or bad direction depending on personal preference. For what the actual categories encompass, I have a short explainer on the <ExternalLink href="https://gamerater.vercel.app/">Game Rater</ExternalLink> website but I'll list what they mean here.
