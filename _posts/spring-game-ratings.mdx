Hello and welcome to a set of short and sweet reviews on the games I have played so far in 2024 (technically starting from my Christmas break in 2023). I want to do this for all the games I was planning on playing throughout the year, and I still intend to, but waiting until the very end of the year to do this would result in a massive list, and I don't want to wait a full year to write about these games. So I decided to do 3 times in the year, a sort of seasonal approach (yes I am aware there are 4 seasons but fall barely exists in Toronto).

## Ratings breakdown

A quick explainer of how my ratings work. A couple years ago I made a small website called <ExternalLink href="https://gamerater.vercel.app/">Game Rater</ExternalLink> that makes small sharable images for game reviews in the style of GamePro magazine. Each category goes from 1 to 5 (5 being the best) and encompasses a handful of elements rather than strictly what the title of it is. What each numerical rating can equate to for me personally can be found on the legend image <span className="desktop-only">to the right</span><span className="mobile-only">above</span>.

For the numerical ratings themselves 2.5 is what I would consider a baseline, meaning it isn't _really_ bad but it's definitely not _good_. It's kind of _meh_ and how someone else may feel about it could swing in either a good or bad direction depending on their personal preferences. For what the actual categories encompass, I have a short explainer on the <ExternalLink href="https://gamerater.vercel.app/">Game Rater</ExternalLink> website but I'll list what they mean here.

## Christmas break

I had holidays starting a few days before Christmas up until just after the new year. I would be staying with my parents and partner's parents for most of that time, so I brought my Steam Deck with a handful of games that I had bought in the past and yet to play. I always treat this parent holiday stay as a sort of "catch up" time for media that I'm interested in but never got around to. Wether it be movies, games, or plain old TV, the vibes are always great since it's a lot of lounging around in a part of Niagara that's dark and quiet.

## Immortality

Immortality is a really experience. It's a game I have thought a fair bit about since I've played it and have grown to appreciate it more. I wrote a <InternalLink to="/blog/immortality-review">review</InternalLink> that goes into a lot more detail after I finished the game that I actually went back to to write a small edit to what I initially rated the game. One of the main issues I had with the game is that it is very easy to miss content that is important to the story and characters. That being said, the narrative and its presentation is so strong that I wanted to go back and see everything I had not yet seen after being randomly presented the ending, and only partially understanding it because I had missed some very important context. There are also many scenes that aren't necessarily important to the overall plot but have some incredible character building in them. I absolutely love the integration, interpretations, and presentation of religion and its symbols in media, and Immortality by far has my favourite interpretation of Christianity.

I would say beating this game two long play sessions, plus a third hour long one to view scenes I had missed prior to the ending, was a bit of a mistake. It is an FMV game and there is a lot video to watch through. I was so hooked during my first play session that I ended up going for about five hours before stopping. If I had paced the following play session out a bit more there's a reasonable chance I would have enjoyed the later bits a bit more. I will say playing this game on a Steam Deck was, to my surprise, a fantastic experience. Lying in bed and watching parts parts of movies was a great time, and the control scheme matched so well to the deck layout.

Being the first game I played on my holiday and it being something so fresh, cool, and different, it really inspired me to go on a binge of games. I feel like it's been a while since I've really played through single player games and I definitely have been missing out on a lot of truly great stuff.

## VVVVVV

VVVVVV is a platforming game where instead of jumping you invert gravity. I bought it roughly 1 million years ago, played for 37 minutes, and then never touched again. I'm not exactly sure why I didn't continue it, maybe I just wasn't feeling it. however, this was when I was in second year of college and very into Path of Exile, Team Fortress 2, and Magic the Gathering, so I probably just wanted to jam those games instead. Regardless, I decided to finally play through it since I wanted something short and low effort to play. And I have to say it delivered on both those fronts. It certainly feels like an indie game from 2010, which while isn't a negative, it definitely elicits a specific kind of vibe and feel. Many of the platforming challenges have the right level of challenge and a few of the optional hidden items to get are quite difficult. It's certainly the kind of game you try for the challenge of the platforming and pretty much nothing else.

## Celeste 64

Celeste is one of my all time favourite games, and the team at EXOK sometimes make a small game to celebrate the anniversary of Celeste's release. Celeste 64 was released to celebrate Celeste's sixth anniversary and is made to mimic the style of Nintendo 64 era 3D platformers. You have the same basic gameplay elements of dashing and climbing found in the original game, but you are now collecting strawberries hidden throughout a small 3D world similar to what you would find inside a painting in Super Mario 64.

Dashing in the game can be a little unwieldy and doesn't feel nearly as smooth as its 2D counterpart. Although, it is hard to be that nit-picky about the feel of it when the game was made by the team in a week. The world has a fair bit to explore and offers some great short platforming segments leading to strawberries. There are actually a fair amount to find, and some are hidden very well. I didn't find 3 of the 30 total strawberries in the game. The visual style totally captures the early 3D aesthetic of games. I wish I could see how it looks on a CRT, I can only imagine how cool it is. Overall the game offers a great 1-2 hour playthrough and is definitely something I would recommend checking out if you are into 3D platformers.

## Bat Boy

Bat Boy is a 2D side-scrolling action platformer, very much in the vein of classic Mega Man games. The protagonist is a baseball player who's friends are all into a various sport, and get possessed by some evil guy in the beginning of the game. Your friends become the bosses at the end of each stage (Ã  la 8 evil robot masters) who give you a new ability after defeating them. I picked it up on a wim after seeing it being used as b-roll footage in a YouTube video and loved the Game Boy Color aesthetic.

I don't have a lot to say about this game, it kind of does exactly what you would expect or want out of a game like this. The gameplay is decent, it can be challenging in some portions and can be a little frustrating in others. It functions quite similarly to a classic Mega Man game, with the exception that your attacks are primarily melee based. This makes some sections annoying to get through. There are some neat side challenges the game offers which reward you with a power up at the end of them. I didn't actually end up beating all the stages in the game. I had a couple stages left and didn't have any desire to continue playing. I feel as if it is going to just be more of the same ok game loop.

## Pepper Grinder

This was a game that I was looking forward to playing after seeing the reveal trailer, maybe during a Nintendo indie showcase? Pepper Grinder is another 2D action platformer with a very cute pixel art style (I have a type). The main gameplay gimmick is that you have a drill that lets you burrow into soft environments and sorta swim like a dolphin. It blends a bunch of various game styles throughout the entirety of the game which leads to an overall kind of confusing game feel. It almost seems like the game didn't know what exactly it wants to be. Some levels your drilling and trying to go maintain a high speed, which feels great, other levels you jump into a Metal Slug and just plow through buildings and enemies, and some levels you alternate between the two?

I feel as if the developer had a lot of ideas that they wanted to execute on, but didn't have enough runway to get them off the ground. The game is relatively short with 4 worlds of 5-6 levels each. The first world focuses on the main mechanic of drilling through the environment and overall feels reasonably cohesive. but then they start throwing other mechanics in to each level and have little to no expansion on them in future levels (with some exceptions). There are a lot of good ideas in the game but they can feel pretty half-baked or extremely rushed. If there were more levels with a greater focus on individual ideas that blended better with the main mechanic of drilling, this game could be fantastic. However, with how few levels there are and how little opportunity the game play is given to shine, it ends of feeling like a bit of a mess.

The bosses in the game feel miserable to fight. They have too much health and all have a very basic pattern to play around. I get the sense that they designed the last boss first (which I thought was the best made of the 4) and worked backwards removing mechanics. Platformers have such under-explored space in boss design. They always boil down to some dude at the end of world you need to jump on X number of times. Having them be incorporated into levels, or even something basic like making it a race is such a step up from this tired formula. I would like to formally request that platforming games please stop adding bosses to their games just because they feel like they have to.

All that being said, I did play through the entire game and enjoyed it. I really like the visual style and the world map and music evokes a sort of Yoshi's Island / Story feel with its storybook aesthetic. There are a small number of collectibles and extras in the game such as a sticker book, which is cute but doesn't really add much. Overall this is one of those games where you can skip out on, or wait for a sale if you are interested. It's a bit unfortunate because with some more time in the oven I feel like this could've been a really great game.
