Hello and welcome to a set of short and sweet reviews on the games I have played so far in 2024 (technically starting from my Christmas break in 2023). I want to do this for all the games I was planning on playing throughout the year, and I still intend to, but waiting until the very end of the year to do this would result in a massive list, and I don't want to wait a full year to write about these games. So I decided to do 3 times in the year, a sort of seasonal approach (yes I am aware there are 4 seasons but fall barely exists in Toronto).

## Ratings breakdown

A quick explainer of how my ratings work. A couple years ago I made a small website called <ExternalLink href="https://gamerater.vercel.app/">Game Rater</ExternalLink> that makes small sharable images for game reviews in the style of GamePro magazine. Each category goes from 1 to 5 (5 being the best) and encompasses a handful of elements rather than strictly what the title of it is. What each numerical rating can equate to for me personally can be found on the legend image <span className="desktop-only">to the right</span><span className="mobile-only">above</span>.

For the numerical ratings themselves 2.5 is what I would consider a baseline, meaning it isn't _really_ bad but it's definitely not _good_. It's kind of _meh_ and how someone else may feel about it could swing in either a good or bad direction depending on their personal preferences. For what the actual categories encompass, I have a short explainer on the <ExternalLink href="https://gamerater.vercel.app/">Game Rater</ExternalLink> website but I'll list what they mean here.

## Christmas break

I had holidays starting a few days before Christmas up until just after the new year. I would be staying with my parents and partner's parents for most of that time, so I brought my Steam Deck with a handful of games that I had bought in the past and yet to play. I always treat this parent holiday stay as a sort of "catch up" time for media that I'm interested in but never got around to. Wether it be movies, games, or plain old TV, the vibes are always great since it's a lot of lounging around in a part of Niagara that's dark and quiet.

### Immortality

Immortality is a really great game. It is definitely a game I have thought a fair bit about since I've played it and have grown to appreciate it more. I wrote a <InternalLink to="/blog/immortality-review">review</InternalLink> that goes into a lot more detail after I finished the game that I actually went back to to write a small edit to what I initially rated the game. One of the main issues I had with the game is that it is very easy to miss content that is important to the story and characters. That being said, the narrative and its presentation is so strong that I wanted to go back and see everything I had not yet seen after being randomly presented the ending, and only partially understanding it because I had missed some very important context. There are also many scenes that aren't necessarily important to the overall plot but have some incredible character building in them.

I would say beating this game two long play sessions, plus a third hour long one to view scenes I had missed prior to the ending, was a bit of a mistake. It is an FMV game and there is a lot video to watch through. I was so hooked during my first play session that I ended up going for about five hours before stopping. If I had paced the following play session out a bit more there's a reasonable chance I would have enjoyed the later bits a bit more. I will say playing this game on a Steam Deck was, to my surprise, a fantastic experience. Lying in bed and watching parts parts of movies was a great time, and the control scheme matched so well to the deck layout.

Being the first game I played on my holiday and it being something so fresh, cool, and different, it really inspired me to go on a binge of single player games. I feel like it's been a while since I've really gone through games and I definitely have been missing out on a lot of truly great stuff.
