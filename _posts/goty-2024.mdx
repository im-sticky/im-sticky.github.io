I played a lot of different games this year. Actually kind of unusual for me, I'm not one to play a little of many different games, but generally play a lot of few individual games.

## Game roundup retrospective

I had a great time not only playing all of the games I did this year, but also writing my mini reviews / summaries for of all the games. I put a lot of time and effort into not only the writing the posts but also improvements to the actual blog itself. Both in terms of architecture and visuals. I learned a lot about how I write, how I want to be able to write, and what is too much. I definitely struggled with the "too much" aspect of these posts. I plan to continue making these game roundups in 2025 but I am going to put more effort into keeping them more bite sized and general. I put too many specific details into some of my summaries and ended up leaning to heavily into critical reviews rather than approachable bite sized summaries.

With all that in the books, lets get into the awards!
