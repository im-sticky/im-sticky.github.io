There were enough people at our office that we could potentially host a marathon similar to (although much shorter than) Awesome Games Done Quick. Since our companies initials are KG, it naturally became KGDQ and was a perfect homage to AGDQ. This idea sat on the shelf for quite some time. But, my coworker determined as he is, revived the idea relatively recently and floated it to the people of our company to see if there was interest for people to learn games to run. The idea is: runs that are max 1 hour long to complete, doesn't have to be a competitive time, anyone can learn a short run they're interested in, would be hosted in the office after work for a few hours. There was a pretty positive response and many people were willing to learn a short run for the event.\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"I have always wanted to learn to speedrun Celeste.

However, KGDQ gave me an opportunity to learn it in a non-threatening environment.
