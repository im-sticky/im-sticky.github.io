This is all supplemented by you finding piece by piece the in game instruction manual. A manual that has been very carefully crafted to mimic the manuals of games from long ago. Full color illustrations, maps marked up by pen on where to find secrets, notes about what items do. Each time you find a page from the manual a new piece of information about the game is revealed to you.

The game pushes and rewards you to really scour the various areas. However, it isn't all just combing the overworld. There are puzzles written in the manual made for you to decipher. The game has some hidden spots that are oddly empty that eventually make sense after figuring out what are seemingly random pen scratchings on various pages throughout the manual.
