It's been quite a while now and I don't actually have a full run time to my name yet. The last chapter is the last step before I can start actually doing runs, so there is definitely a bit more pressure there to hurry up and finish learning it. Another factor I think amy be at play is the fact that the chapter you have multiple dashes to work with. More dashes equals more opportunities for faster strats, which in turn is more opportunity to mess up.

That external force has not been affecting my practice yet, but the closer we get to February to more it will. The goal is still to have a reasonable run by the end of the year.
