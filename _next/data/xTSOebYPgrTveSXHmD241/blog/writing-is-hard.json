However having a space where I can publish long form thoughts that would otherwise be fleeting has proven to be very mentally relaxing for me. There are many ideas and posts that don't make it through to being actually published for one reason or another, but the ones that do I put a fair bit of effort into writing and proofreading, bringing me to my main point.

I am a developer and have been so professionally for many years now. In my time spent learning and doing development, I have gotten good enough to the point where I'm able to \\\"autopilot\\\" certain aspects of it. This results in me being able to have entertainment on in the background such as TV shows or live-streams and still do what I need to do at a reasonable pace. Having background noise on has become such a normal thing in my life that I do it while doing most things. And so, I try to write while having some form of media on at the same time, and it is such a bad idea. Due to the fact that I have only recently picked up writing as an actual hobby and am still very bad at it, I have no real \\\"autopilot\\\" that I can fall back on. This may not even be something that I can learn to do and will probably have to accept that every time I want to write I must free myself from all other distractions so I'm able to focus on constructing cohesive paragraphs.

The amount of times I've had to erase words such as \\\"also\\\", \\\"so\\\", and \\\"anyways\\\" from the beginning of my sentences has made me uncomfortably conscience of the fact that I do it a ton in my regular speech. I certainly don't think it's a bad thing to have any noticeable personal patterns in the way you write or speak, but reading it back to myself it does get very repetitive.
