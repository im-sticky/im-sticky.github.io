Hello and welcome to another season in review for MTG Arena! I didn't write one for June or May because I wasn't playing very much Arena outside of my daily quests. This month however, I was really jamming with a pet deck of mine and ended off the season pretty decently. The deck is a B/W <auto-card name="Yorion, Sky Nomad">Yorion</auto-card> <auto-card>Doom Foretold</auto-card>. I'm a big fan of cards that have weird or unusual conditions to get payout from them. <auto-card>Doom Foretold</auto-card> (and several other cards in the deck) fit that bill perfectly, and I like that it forces you to build around it. In the right shell with the right curve it puts in a **ton** of work.

## Season review

This season was an interesting one on the ladder. It felt like there were clear periods of days where certain decks or archetypes were mostly what was on ladder. I'm guessing people were influenced by popular streamers or if certain decks did well in tournaments, but it usually doesn't feel as rigid as it did this month. Another thing, <auto-card>Brainstorm</auto-card> was banned 2/3rds of the way through the season. When that happened the ladder definitely became far more infested with aggro decks.
